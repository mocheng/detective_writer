# Detective Novel Generator - Requirements

## 1. Overview Vision

The Detective Novel Generator is an AI-powered system that creates complete, coherent detective novels through a step-by-step, iterative process. The system first generates a comprehensive outline containing background, characters, plot structure, and key elements, which can be reviewed and refined before proceeding to chapter generation. This iterative approach ensures high-quality output that follows classic mystery conventions while allowing for user feedback and adjustments throughout the creation process.
